Please visit [the installers section of the MNE documentation](https://mne.tools/dev/install/installers.html) for instructions on how to use them.

## Development

Locally, installers can be built using `tools/build_local.sh`. This has only been tested on Linux and macOS M1.

Requirements:
- `conda` with `constructor` (`conda install -c conda-forge constructor`)

      WARNING: Your constructor will be patched on macOS.
